# AlgSortVisUI
 Sorting Algorithm Visualisator 
The project requires the user to have a downloaded SFML library, it can be downloaded from the official SFML website or using the link - https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.6.1-windows-vc17-64-bit.zip. The downloaded archive should be unzipped and stored as follows C:\SFML-2.6.1. If the program is throwing errors then additional configurations might be needed. A good example is shown here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfMQyOw1zik&t=187.
